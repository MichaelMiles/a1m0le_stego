# @1m0le Steganoraphy
This is my own version of steganography.

## How to use
After downloading or pulling the file go to the project folder. You should see two folders `build` and `src`.
Go to `src`, run `make`.
go back and go to `build`, and run `a1m0le_stego`
provide the files needed as instructed.

## Update History
Nov. 8th, 2018: naive version works on hidding image or executables in another image. size is still limited to 8x.
